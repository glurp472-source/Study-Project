# Study-Project
This repository exists as a central hub for all my programming learning and experimentation, covering everything from high-level languages like Python, JavaScript, and Java to low-level languages like Assembly. Each folder and project represents a stage in my journey, whether it's studying computer science concepts, exploring web frameworks, or experimenting with code closer to the hardware.

The goal of the “Study Project” is to organize all the knowledge I acquire, allowing me to:

Review and consolidate concepts I’ve learned.

Have practical examples of each language, framework, or technology I study.

Share my learning openly so others can study, get inspired, or contribute.

While this repository is public, each project is a study piece and not necessarily a finished product. The focus is on the learning process, experimentation, and documenting knowledge rather than on production-ready solutions.

In short, “Study Project” is my digital technical diary, a space to test ideas, learn from mistakes, record discoveries, and evolve as a developer. Every commit, folder, and line of code reflects a step in this journey.
